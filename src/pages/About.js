        <p>
          I started my journey in the world of computers from an young age, now
          Iâ€™m 29 years old, Pursuing my Software Engineering Degree in VIT
          University Vellore. Web development is my center of interest, i always
          love the idea of cross-platform development, 1-n one code base deploy
          into almost any platform, which web technology like Javascript enables
          me to do. I also like creating Interactive UI components for better UX
          and share those desgin and codes to the world through Github, Codepen
          and Instagram.
